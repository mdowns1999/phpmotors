# PhpMotors Overview
Welcome to Phpmotors!  This program is a website that practices using a relational database and PHP.  The website follows a model, view, and control system.  The model handles everything relatied to the database, the controllers handle what kind of actions or routes need to be take, and the view is what the client sees and interacts with.
